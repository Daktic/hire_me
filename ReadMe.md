# A CLI SPARQL RDF Example
This project should hopefully highlight my ability to work in Rust 
and turn around a project in an unfamiliar time in a relatively short amount of time.

## Goals
 -[ ] Set up mock triple-store DB to house RDF data
 -[ ] Provide utility to upload RDF data
 -[ ] provide CLI for making SPARQL commands
 -[ ] display Query results in a legible format.

## Starting Architecture
This project will container a lib for a reusable codebase, 
as well as a binary to hold the CLI and provide a working example.

## Setup and Environment
